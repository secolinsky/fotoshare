# Introduction
I have a samba server with photos I've amassed over the few years since my daughter was born.  I'd like to have a custom app to show all pictures on a nice
dispaly in the house.  Because I don't use Facebook, or any other service to store my photos, I need to find a solution that uses my samba NAS server to
enjoy and watch the photos of my daughter's growth and development over the years.
